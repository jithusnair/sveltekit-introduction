		title: 'Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore?',
		synopsis: `
    <p>
    The film follows Jeff Smith from inside his campaign during his bid to win the Democratic primary 
    for the House seat of Representative Dick Gephardt, who announced his retirement. Smith, a 29-year-old
     teacher with no political experience, decided to run for the seat against 10 other Democratic candidates 
     including Russ Carnahan, a member of the Carnahan political family. He was instantly dismissed by 
     pundits who saw him as a no-name candidate due to his lack of political expertise and the presence 
     of a Carnahan in the race.
    </p>

    Smith's campaign begins to gain more support as he mobilizes a large grassroots political campaign. 
    He earns the endorsement of Howard Dean at one of his speaking events, and his campaign cuts into Carnahan's 
    initial 30-point lead. Smith, however, loses the campaign by fewer than 2,000 votes.
